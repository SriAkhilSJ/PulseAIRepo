# Hermes prompt engine + Agent UI → Pulse: verification evidence

Provider-free run. Zero LLM/provider tokens. No API key present in this
environment, so nothing here depends on a metered call.

**Upstream pin:** `NousResearch/hermes-agent @ a9c783f21995723c812dcb2f8ae58bc6a4323e2f`
**Pulse base:** `86eaaae2` (branch `arena/01a0564d-pulseairepo`)
**Run:** 2026-08-31 (UTC) — see the header of each log for the exact timestamp.

## Files

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `pytest.log` | the two port suites (57 + 10 tests), then the full backend suite, verbatim output |
| `webview.log` | `npx tsc -b`, `npm test`, `npx vite build`, plus a CSS smoke check against the built stylesheet |
| `hashes.txt` | upstream per-file sha256 at the pin, and sha256 of every ported file (prompt engine, tests, UI, stylesheet) |

## Results

### Prompt engine — `src/prompts/hermes/` (9 modules, 2 683 lines of module code)

```
src/tests/test_hermes_prompt_parity.py          57 passed
src/tests/test_hermes_prompt_session_cache.py   10 passed
both, together                                  67 passed in 1.93s
```

What the 57 assert, grouped:

- **fidelity** — 12 guidance/steer blocks (memory, user profile, session search,
  skills, task completion, parallel calls, tool-use enforcement, OpenAI/Google
  execution guidance, the three steer-channel constants) equal
  `localize(upstream_bytes)` and nothing else;
  the identity block differs from upstream only by the self-name swap;
  `CONTEXT_FILE_MAX_CHARS = 20_000`, head/tail `0.7 / 0.2` are upstream's numbers;
  the corpus re-hashes clean against the pinned checkout (skips if absent).
- **branding** — no upstream vendor token anywhere in the corpus, in the assembled
  prompt, or in the emitted plan/learn turn prompts.
- **assembly** — three bands in order, identity first, `Conversation started:` only
  in the volatile band, stable bytes identical across sessions, mode hint volatile.
- **gating** — memory/user-profile/session-search/skills/steer/task-completion/
  parallel blocks follow the *bound* tool set; the per-model table behaves; the
  `execution_guidance` override accepts `"auto" | True | False | list`; a guidance
  line naming an unbound tool is dropped rather than left dangling.
- **context files** — priority chain, single-winner per directory, AGENTS.md
  injected exactly once, frontmatter/BOM stripped, truncation notice text,
  `# Project Context` frame, threat pattern → `BLOCKED`.
- **cache** — `find_stable_prefix(stable + tail) == stable`; the plan marks the
  system prefix and, on LiteLLM-shaped routes, never a tool-part marker.
- **/plan and /learn** — headers, `.pulseai/plans/` filename grammar, task
  inference from context, the skill-tool vs `write_file` branch.

What the 10 session-cache tests assert: the prompt is built **once per session**, a
second turn reuses the identical string, compression and session reset invalidate,
a degraded graph path cannot leak a per-turn prompt, and the kill switch
(`PULSEAI_STABLE_PREFIX=0`) turns the mechanism off without changing the text.

### Backend suite — regression check

```
1200 passed, 6 failed, 3 skipped in 242.64s
```

The 6 failures are pre-existing and unrelated (they reference the deleted `ui/`
tree, plus one Sarvam-request test that fails identically on the pristine base —
verified earlier by `git stash`). The port added 67 tests and removed zero passes.

### Agent UI — `pulse-webview/src/hermes-ui/` (42 files, 7 217 lines incl. stylesheet)

```
npx tsc -b        exit 0
npm test          48 passed (2 files)   # 9 pre-existing + 39 ported-UI tests
npx vite build    ok
CSS smoke         pulse-tool-ticker__reel=1  pulse-scaffold-label=1
                  pulse-diff-line--add=1  pulse-approval__run=1
                  pulse-stable-text__cell=1     (counts inside dist/assets/*.css)
```

The 39 ported-UI tests are provider-free: they mount the real components with a
synthetic transcript and assert DOM — grouping and collapse rules, the
render-cost budget, diff parsing and clamping, bridge-frame replay (flat
`tool_id`/`name`/`arguments`/`result`/`warning`/`diff`, plus `safety_resolved`
clearing a request and unknown frames being no-ops), approval binding to Pulse's
`ApprovalQueue` contract, per-message disclosure persistence, the changed-files
card, and the branding guard over a fully rendered `textContent`.

## What this does **not** claim

- No live provider call was made, so nothing here measures real cache-hit rates or
  streaming cadence against a model. That is the key run.
- Pulse only enables the approval channel on bridge sessions today
  (`approval_channel=True` in `src/bridge/__main__.py`); the ported approval strip
  is verified against that contract, not against a Copilot-tier emission.
- The desktop fork is untouched this round: it inherits the same webview through
  its iframe, which is why no fork edit was needed for parity.
- Renderer gaps that are documented rather than hidden (no Shiki, no codicons, no
  side-diff channel, no Motion spring on `DiffCount`): see
  `src/prompts/hermes/PROVENANCE.md` §7.
